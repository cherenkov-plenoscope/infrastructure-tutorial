Infrastructure Tutorial
#######################

Abstract
  This tutorial shows the infrastructure I use to work with remote computers. The goal of the methods and tools shown here is to automate repetetive tasks, avoid common pitfals, and to gain awareness of fairshare in case there are multiple users. This tutorial is not meant to be complete. It is just a summary of the methods and tools I learned to use over the time.

Text-files
==========
Most configurations on your local and remote computer are written in text-files.
It is important that you are familiar with text-editors that run without a graphical-user-interface (GUI) in an x-server, but directly in the terminal.

Newlines
--------
A big pitfall with text-files are the multiple ways to indicate that a newline is starting.
The text-editors on your local machine might use a different newline indicator than your remote machine.
Most common in the linux is the ``\n`` newline indicator. 

Tools I use
-----------

* ``vim``
* ``emacs``
* ``less``
* ``hexdump``
* ``wc``
